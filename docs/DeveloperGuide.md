## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### Commands

#### Overview

The abstract class `Command` has been implemented to introduce an additional layer
of abstraction between the `AppUi` class and command execution,
allowing for separation of handling command keywords and executing commands.

The diagram below shows the inheritance of the `Command` class.

### Exceptions and Logging

An exception class `FinanceBuddyException` is thrown when users use the product wrongly.
Exceptions are caught at the nearest instance that they occur.
