### FinancialList Component

#### Overview

The `FinancialList` class is responsible for storing and managing all financial entries in the application,
including both `Expense` and `Income`. The `FinancialEntry` class acts as the base class, with `Expense` and `Income` 
classes extending it to represent specific types of transactions.

#### Class Structure

The `FinancialList` class contains the following attributes:
- entries: A list of FinancialEntry objects representing all stored transactions.

The `FinancialEntry` class contains the following attributes:
- **description**: A string describing the transaction.
- **amount**: A double representing the amount of the transaction.
- **date**: A LocalDate object representing the date of the transaction.

The Expense and Income classes extend FinancialEntry, each maintaining the base attributes while
adding context to the type of financial entry.

### Implementation Details

### Commands

<ins>Overview</ins>

The abstract class `Command` has been implemented to introduce an additional layer
of abstraction between the `CommandHandler` class and command execution,
allowing for separation of handling command keywords and executing commands.

The diagram below shows the inheritance of the `Command` class. The diagram is only meant to show
the hierarchy of classes and have been greatly simplified.

{Insert diagram here}

<ins>Constructor</ins>

The `Command` constructor updates the attributes based on the input arguments.

<ins>Methods</ins>

The abstract `Command` class and its related children classes have the following method:

- *execute*: Effect the command based on the corresponding child class.

### Adding Entries

<ins>Overview</ins>

The feature to add entries is facilitated by the `AddExpenseCommand` and `AddIncomeCommand`
classes.

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

The `AddExpenseCommand` class has the following attributes:
- *amount*: An object representing the amount of money used in the transaction.
- *description*: An object representing the description of the transaction.
- *date*: An object representing the date on which the transaction occurred.

The `AddEntryCommand` class has the following method:
- *execute*

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The user invokes the command to add entries by entering the following command:
`income [DESCRIPTION] /a AMOUNT [/d DATE]`.

This is parsed by the InputParser, returning a HashMap `commandArguments`, containing the
following arguments:
- `argument`: Represents the description of the entry. The value can be left blank.
- `/a`: Represents the amount of money used in the transaction. This is a compulsory argument.
- `/d`: Represents the date on which the transaction occurred. If this argument is not used,
  the current date is used. An exception occurs if this argument is used but the value is left blank.

### Editing Entries

<ins>Overview</ins>

The feature to add entries is facilitated by the `EditEntryCommand`. Both `Income` and `Expense`
can be edited using this one class.

<ins>Class Structure</ins>

The `EditEntryCommand` class has the following attributes:
- *index*: An object representing the index of the entry in the full financial list.
- *amount*: An object representing the amount of money used in the transaction.
- *description*: An object representing the description of the transaction.
- *date*: An object representing the date on which the transaction occurred.

The `EditEntryCommand` class has the following method:
- *execute*

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The user invokes the command to add entries by entering the following command:
`edit INDEX [/des DESCRIPTION] [/a AMOUNT] [/d DATE]`.

This is parsed by the InputParser, returning a HashMap `commandArguments`, containing the
following arguments:
- `argument`: Represents the index of the entry in the full financial list.
  This is a compulsory argument.
- `/des`: Represents the description of the transaction. This is an optional argument.
- `/a`: Represents the amount of money used in the transaction. This is an optional argument.
- `/d`: Represents the date on which the transaction occurred. This is an optional argument.

### Listing Entries
__Overview__

The list entries feature is facilitated by the `SeeAllEntriesCommand` class.
Similarly, classes `SeeAllExpensesCommand` and `SeeAllIncomesCommand` facilitate 
listing out expenses and incomes respectively.

__Implementation__

The user invokes the command to list entries by entering the following command:
```list [income|expense] [/from START_DATE] [/to END_DATE]```.

This is parsed by the InputParser, returning a HashMap `commandArgumets`, containing the following optional arguments:
- `argument`: Represents the type of Financial Entries to be printed. Can take 3 possible values:
  - `expense`: List only Expenses
  - `income`: List only Incomes
  - `null`: List both Expenses and Incomes
- `/from`: Represents the starting date from which Financial Entries should be listed. If value is `null`,
there is no defined starting date.
- `/to`: Represents the ending date by which Financial Entries should be listed. If value is `null`,
  there is no defined ending date.

`CommandHandler` invokes the `listHelper` method to create and execute the command to list the financial entries
according to the following logic.

{add in diagram}

The interaction between the command classes and the `FinancialList` is as follows,
using `SeeAllEntriesCommand` as an example:

{add diagram}

The `shouldBeIncluded()` method marks Financial Entries as "should be included" if their
dates fall between the start and end dates passed into the command object.

`SeeAllExpensesCommand` and `SeeAllIncomesCommand` interact with the `FinancialList` in a 
similar manner, with the only difference being that the `shouldBeIncluded()` methods of
`SeeAllExpensesCommand` and `SeeAllIncomesCommand` only mark `Expenses` and `Incomes` as "should be included".

__Design Considerations__

Given that the logic for `SeeAllEntriesCommand`, `SeeAllExpensesCommand` and `SeeAllIncomesCommand` are very similar 
with the only difference being the criteria for printing the entries, we made `SeeAllExpensesCommand` and 
`SeeAllIncomesCommand` inherit `SeeAllEntriesCommand` to reduce the amount of duplicated code written.

### Exceptions and Logging

An exception class `FinanceBuddyException` is thrown when users use the product wrongly.
Exceptions are caught at the nearest instance that they occur.

### Storage

__Overview__

The `Storage` class has been implemented to store the `FinancialList` into a file. 
Also it's responsible for restoring users' progress even if they have terminate the program using the saved file.

__Implementation Details__

The function `updateStorage` should be called whenever the `FinancialList` in an `AppUi` object. 
It will overide the `data/FinancialList.txt` file with the up-to-date `FinancialList` that has been converted to string.
Note: if the `data/FinancialList.txt` file doesn't exist, the program should generate one.

The storage format of an `Expense` or `Income`, handled by `toStorageString()` method is different from the format generate by `toString()` method for CLS display.

EX:
For an Income with description "Lunch", amount "10.90" and date "2024/10/25":
The `toString()` method will return as `[Income] - Lunch $ 10.90 (on 25/10/24)`
And the `toStorageString()` method will return as `I | 10.90 | Lunch | 25/10/24`

## Product scope
### Target user profile:
- University student who wants to manage their limited finances
